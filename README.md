I am a Statistics PhD student at Cornell Tech. My research interests are sequential decision making and non-parametric inference, with applications to personalized decision making. I am co-advised by [Raaz Dwivedi](https://raazdwivedi.github.io) and [Kengo Kato](https://sites.google.com/site/kkatostat/home/research?authuser=0).
